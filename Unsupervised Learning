Unsupervised Learning


As the name implies, unsupervised learning is a machine learning technique in which models are not supervised by a training dataset. Instead, models discover hidden patterns and insights in the given data. It can be compared to the learning process that occurs in the human brain when learning something new.

Key Concepts

    Unsupervised learning, unlike supervised learning, only involves input data without corresponding output labels. Therefore, it isn't directly used for regression or classification tasks.
    The aim of unsupervised learning is to explore the inherent structure of the data, group similar items together, and represent the data in a simplified format.

Uses

    This type of learning finds applications in customer segmentation, detecting anomalies, and building recommendation systems.

The Unsupervised Learning Process

    Data Preparation: This step includes gathering, cleaning, and preprocessing the data.
    Model Selection: Selection of the appropriate algorithm, such as K-Means for clustering or PCA for reducing dimensionality.
    Training: The algorithm learns patterns in the data without any labels.
    Evaluation: The model is evaluated using suitable metrics or through visual assessments.

Implementing Unsupervised Learning

    Gather Data: Assemble and preprocess the dataset.
    Choose a Model: Pick a suitable unsupervised learning algorithm.
    Train the Model: Allow the algorithm to analyze the data.
    Analyze Results: Review the findings to glean insights.
    Iterate: Adjust and refine the model based on feedback and repeat the process.

Beginning Steps

    Prerequisites: Prepare your environment with necessary libraries like Scikit-learn, Pandas, etc.
    Running Experiments: Carry out experiments by running unsupervised learning models on your data.
    Observing Outcomes: Examine the outputs to decode the patterns recognized by the algorithm.
