## Purpose & Learning Outcomes
The purpose of this section is to apply **unsupervised learning** methods to datasets and extract meaningful patterns without using labeled targets.

By completing the work in this folder, you demonstrate the ability to:
- Apply unsupervised learning for exploratory data analysis
- Reduce dimensionality to support visualization and insight generation
- Perform clustering to discover natural groupings in data
- Interpret results through plots and quantitative evaluation where applicable
- Build end-to-end workflows including preprocessing, modeling, and analysis in notebooks
