# Supervised Learning

## Overview
This folder contains implementations of **supervised machine learning algorithms** organized by model type. Each subfolder includes the corresponding notebook(s) and supporting files used to train models, evaluate performance, and interpret results across both **classification** and **regression** tasks.

## Datasets Used
The supervised learning models in this folder use the following datasets:

- **Real-estate-dataset.csv**
- **heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset2.csv**
- **WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv**
- **diabetes_data_upload.csv**
- **advertising.csv**
- **winequality-red (1).csv**

In addition, several notebooks use **built-in scikit-learn datasets**, including:
- Wine dataset (`load_wine`)
- Breast Cancer dataset (`load_breast_cancer`)
- California Housing dataset (`fetch_california_housing`)
